" default: 0 (0: local, 1: cloud) 
let g:pi2md_localstorage_strategy = 0
" default: 0 (0: current dir, 1: absolute path) if you use cloud , ignore it
let g:pi2md_localstorage_dirname = 'images'
" (optional) default: images, if you select use absolute path, no need to define it 
let g:pi2md_localstorage_path = '/Users/vincent/Pictures'
" (optional) no default value, if you use local storage strategy 1, you must define it
let g:pi2md_localstorage_prefer_relative = 0
" (optional) defaut: 0, 1: try to use relative path first
```

## Example

let g:pi2md_localstorage_strategy = 0
let g:pi2md_localstorage_dirname = 'images'
let g:pi2md_localstorage_prefer_relative = 1
